## Roadmap for Aerospace Engineering

### Airframe Design

-   Introduction to Aircraft Design by John P. Fielding ([link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-885j-aircraft-systems-engineering-fall-2005/lecture-notes/lecture_1.pdf))
-   Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach by Daniel P. Raymer ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Aircraft-Design-Conceptual-Approach/dp/1600869114))

### Aerodynamics (subsonic to supersonic)

-   Fundamentals of Aerodynamics by John Anderson ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Aerodynamics-John-D-Anderson/dp/0073398101))
-   Introduction to Flight by John Anderson ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Flight-John-D-Anderson/dp/0078027675))

### Guidance, Navigation, and Controls

-   Modern  Control Engineering  by Ogata ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Control-Engineering-Katsuhiko-Ogata/dp/0136156738))
-   Feedback Control  of  Dynamic Systems  by Gene Franklin, J. Da Powell, and Michael Workman ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Feedback-Control-Dynamic-Systems-8th/dp/0135263893))

### Propulsion System Design

-   Aircraft Engine Design by Jack D. Mattingly ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Aircraft-Engine-Design-Fourth-Mattingly/dp/1600869114))
-   Gas Turbine Theory by H.I.H. Saravanamuttoo, G.F.C. Rogers, and H. Cohen ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Gas-Turbine-Theory-H-I-H-Saravanamuttoo/dp/0132224372))

These are just a few examples of the many courses and resources available online for Aerospace Engineering. You can search for more courses and resources on platforms such as edX, Coursera, and Udemy. Additionally, many universities offer  online programs  in Aerospace Engineering, such as the  Georgia Institute  of Technology's Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering ([link](https://www.gatech.edu/academics/masters-degrees/aerospace-engineering-ms-online)).
